    we are now only seeing models that are production-ready. It stores all the production-level information we need.”

  <p><span>Canva is one of the </span><a><span>Most Innovative Companies in enterprise software</span></a><span>, with
      the popular design and publishing tool boasting more than 150 million monthly active users. The company has also
      invested heavily in AI, with new suites of AI tools to automatically translate text in Canva designs, add new
      image features, remove unwanted details and much more</span></p>
  <p><span>The focus on AI also extended behind the scenes, where Canva pioneers innovative approaches to machine
      learning operations to help them tackle a whole host of challenges. From generative models and recommendation
      systems to personalization models and search improvements, Canva is deeply invested in ML in the name of creating
      more delightful user experiences. </span></p>
  <p><span>Driving a big part of this ML-driven culture and investment is Thibault Main de Boissiere, the ML Platform
      Team Lead at Canva. Thibault is responsible for helping Canva’s team of over 100 ML engineers train models in a
      reproducible way, enabling those models to be productionized smoothly, and maintaining the team’s pipelines and
      infrastructure. </span></p>
  <p><span>The world-class ML team at Canva relies on Weights &amp; Biases (W&amp;B) for experiment tracking, as well as
      leaning on the Model Registry to serve as the centralized hub and single pane of glass in facilitating
      experimentation into deployment.</span></p>

      <p><span>Thibault and his team wanted a clean separation between experimental models and production-ready models.
          Before using the W&amp;B Model Registry, there was a lot more noise in the entire deployment workflow. It was
          hard to separate production training runs from experimental training runs, and the deployment logic relied on
          a complex combination of tags. Using the W&amp;B Model Registry provided a clear separation between production
          and experimentation, while aliases made it much clearer for users to understand which model would be deployed
          to production or to carry out A/B testing.  </span></p>
      <p><span>With many on the team already using Weights &amp; Biases for experiment tracking, integrating the Model
          Registry proved seamless and hugely impactful.</span></p>

    <p><span>“The W&amp;B Model Registry simplifies our lives in so many ways,” said Thibault. “It brings less noise to
        the user experience, as we are now only seeing models that are production-ready. It stores all the
        production-level information we need.” </span></p>
    <p><span>The W&amp;B Model Registry currently sits at the middle of the ML workflow and tech stack at Canva, that
        also includes leveraging Anyscale to support on-demand notebooks and distributed training, using Nix to manage
        dependencies, and with all production workflows deployed on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). Weights
        &amp; Biases now provides that single pane of glass Thibault and the Canva ML team needs to facilitate
        experimentation, and then ingestion for the deployment process. </span></p>
    <p><span>And the team has even greater ambitions for how they can use Weights &amp; Biases to simplify their ML
        workflow and pipelines. As Thibault describes, “W&amp;B Model Registry can be a key way to change how we’re
        doing ML deployment.” </span></p>
    <p><span>“All our MLEs and some product managers have access to Weights &amp; Biases,” said Thibault. “We love the
        W&amp;B UI, everything out of the box is really useful with very helpful system metrics, and it’s easy to manage
        access and security on the admin side.” </span></p>
